## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorials, you can run the notebooks directly in Google Colab, which allows you to execute code without any local setup.

**OR**

You can also run the notebooks locally, but you will need to install the dependencies and set up a Python environment. We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the Python environment.

Prerequisites:
Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/developmentseed/ingarss-workshop-2024.git
cd ingarss-workshop-2024
uv sync
uv run jupyter lab
```
